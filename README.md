Car on a planet v1 03/29/24

## Project Description

"Car on a Planet" is a simple 3D website where a car moves forwards, backwards, left, and right on a planet's surface. This website is developed using React Three Fiber technology.<br /><br/>
React Three Fiber is a React-based wrapper library for Three.js, facilitating the development of web applications with 3D graphics rendering and interactivity.<br /><br/>
Through this website, users can witness real-time movement of a car navigating across the surface of a planet. Implemented using React Three Fiber, this 3D website offers a sleek yet captivating visual experience.

## Features
> Features that I would like to introduce.

|Feature|Description|
|:--:|:--|
|Interection|<img src="https://github.com/SunilPark1129/car-on-a-planet/assets/106734133/844e823e-8c57-4c50-ab62-4684fe8a5b57" height="400"><br><br>The car allows you to navigate a 360-degree planet surface while moving forward, backward, left, and right using the 'w', 'a', 'd', and 's' keys.|
|Brightness|<img src="https://github.com/SunilPark1129/car-on-a-planet/assets/106734133/fff1616f-fb93-498d-9dae-9219cddfa2bd" height="400"><br><br>To enhance the simple yet immersive 3D feel, I've implemented a design that maximizes the contrast between darkness and brightness.|
|Acceleration|<img src="https://github.com/SunilPark1129/car-on-a-planet/assets/106734133/e68b363e-2a3d-495d-8f61-f911a0e9b19d" height="400"><br><br>I calculate the acceleration of the car so that it gradually speeds up as it moves forward. When the fast-moving car stops, it slows down gradually as it comes to a halt.|
|Models|<img src="https://github.com/SunilPark1129/car-on-a-planet/assets/106734133/998f3e9b-aa07-45cc-bad6-5a650ad77949" height="400"><br><br>While aiming for a simple design, I strived to add intricate details even in less noticeable areas. I personally crafted each model used on this website.|

## Self-improvement

- It was my first website project using Three.js.
- This endeavor required extensive calculations for positioning and rotation in the x, y, and z axes, leading to significant learning opportunities.
